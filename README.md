MEAM Emotion Clustering & Modeling: This repository contains the code and data used to explore how **age** and **thematic content of memories** (derived from clustering) relate to **mixed emotionality** in autobiographical music-evoked memories.

Research Aim: The analysis investigates whether **age** predicts the **degree of emotional complexity (mixed emotions)** recalled in MEAMs, and whether this relationship is **moderated by thematic clusters** derived from SBERT-embedded memory descriptions.

Method Summary:
- **UMAP** used to reduce SBERT embeddings to 2D space.
- **Fuzzy C-Means clustering** applied to UMAP outputs (n=2–4 clusters).
- **Mixed emotions** calculated as the count of GoEmotion-derived binary labels per memory.
- **OLS regression** tested whether Age × Cluster membership predicts mixed emotion scores.

How to Run:

To recreate the analysis:

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the notebooks in Jupyter and run cell-by-cell

Next Steps

- Replace GoEmotion-derived mixed emotion scores with **self-reported** ones
- Integrate **memory age** as a covariate
- Optimize the number of fuzzy clusters for better thematic sensitivity
